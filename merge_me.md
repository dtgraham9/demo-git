# Merge Me
The git history of this file is all messed up because of too many people editing the file.
We will have to do some clever merging to restore it to it's proper form.


# Problem #1
Some letters are missing! This puzzle is solve when the alphabet is restored.
Editing the values yourself is cheating.

a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h
i  j  k  l  m  n  o  p
q  r  s  t  u  v  w  x
y  z

See that wasn't so hard!

# Problem #2
Oh no! Problem #2 is missing! Merge it in to continue! ( Hint: This line should dissapear once you do! )
